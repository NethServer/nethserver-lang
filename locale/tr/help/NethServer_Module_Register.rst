**Note**

    This special version of the :guilabel:`Software center` page is
    designed for resellers and requires Operation Center
    credentials and an Internet connection to work. 

    Resellers can use this page to:

    - Register the server with Operation Center
    - Install or remove software packages

    To obtain credentials you should have previously signed a reseller
    agreement.

Select Server Identifier
========================

Use existing Server Identifier 

    If you are restoring a previously registered server, choose a free
    Server Identifier from the list. You can free an identifier only
    from the Operation Center interface. Refer to the Operation Center documentation about how
    to do this.

Create new Server Identifier

    For new installations, specify the machine name and
    description. The system hostname can be a good choice for the
    machine name field, but we suggest choosing a name that identifies
    this machine uniquely in Operation Center.


Select a customer
=================

The server must be associated with a customer. This form allows you to
select or create a customer record.

Select an existing customer
    
    This is the list of existing reseller's customers. Pick a customer
    from the list.

Create a new customer
    
    For new customers, specify the required informations that will be
    sent to Operation Center to create the new customer record.


Confirm registration
====================

The choices of the previous screens are summarized here. If you find
something is wrong, you can still go back and correct it, or proceed
with the server registration.

The registration may take some time:

* The Server Identifier is assigned 
* The system is updated 

At the end of the procedure the Package Manager is enabled and you can
install additional packages.
