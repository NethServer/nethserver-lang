Trusted networks
=================

For security reasons, some server services are available
only on the local network. Any private networks (eg. networks
connected in VPN) can have the same privileges as the local network
if configured in this panel.

If the network can be reached only using a router, make sure
to create a static route for the network itself
inside the :guilabel:`Static routes` panel.

Create / Modify

network will be able to access services of the server.

Network address
    Network address for the new route.

Network Mask
