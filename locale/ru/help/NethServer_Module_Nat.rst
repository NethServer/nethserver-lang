NAT 1:1
=======

One-to-one NAT is a way to make systems behind a firewall and configured with private IP addresses appear to have public IP addresses.

**Usage**

Public ip alias
	Contains the alias ip associated to **red** interface (readonly)

Local host
	You can insert a *Firewall object* to configure the one-to-one nat to specific host.

In the page are showed all aliases associated to **red** interfaces, with an easy dropdown list you can choose, in the *Local host* input box, the *Firewall object*.

*Empty input means NAT* **not** *configured.*
