Firewall rules
==============

Firewall rules describe what network traffic is allowed or blocked. 
The packets traversing the firewall's zones are analyzed accordingly 
to existing rules.
The first rule that matches the criteria is applied. 

From the main page you can reorder the rules simply by dragging them. 

This page also contains three buttons: 

* Create a rule at the bottom 
* Create a rule to the top 
* Configure

When all desired changes have been completed, click the
:guilabel:`Apply Changes` button to apply the rules.

Configure
=========

Configure basic firewall policies.

Traffic to Internet red interface
  Possible choices are:
    
  * *Allowed*: all traffic from LAN (green) to Internet (red) is enabled by default.
  
  * *Blocked*: all traffic from LAN (green) to Internet (red) is disabled by default.
    
    In this case, you must explicitly create rules for all services
    which need to be allowed. For example, a rule that allows web
    traffic (ports 80 and 443) from green to red.

Ping from Internet
  If enabled, public interfaces (red) will respond to ping requests (ACCEPT). 
  If disabled, public interfaces (red) will discard ping requests (DROP).
  
  To simplify troubleshooting, it is recommended to leave the ping enabled.

MAC validation (IP/MAC binding)
  If enabled, all traffic from hosts in green and blue interfaces is verified against a list of IP with associated MAC addresses.
  The IP/MAC association can be configured using the DHCP page.

Policy for hosts without IP/MAC binding (DHCP reservation)
  If MAC validation is enabled, select the policy for hosts without DHCP reservation.

Create / Edit
=============

When creating and editing rules, you can create the following types of firewall objects: 

* Host 
* Host groups 
* Zone 
* Services 

Each rule consists of the following fields. 

Enabled 
     Enable or disable the rule. 
     A disabled rule is not saved in the configuration file. 

Action 
     The action to take if the packet matches the criteria of the rule. 
     The possible actions are: 

     * *Accept*: accept the network traffic 
     * *Reject*: block the traffic and notify the sender host 
     * *Drop*: block the traffic, packets are dropped and not
       notification is sent to the sender host

Source
    It's the source of the traffic, it can be: a host, a group of hosts or a zone.

Destination
    It's the destination of the traffic, it can be: a host, a group of hosts or a zone.

Service
    A service network consisting of protocol and port (optional).

Write to log if this rule matches
    If enabled, all matched packets will be recorded in the log file
    :file:`/var/log/firewall.log`.

Description
    Optional description.
